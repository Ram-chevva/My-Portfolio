                <p>The Certification Web Application is a platform that enables employees to manage their certifications. 
                    Users can log in to their accounts and view the certifications they have earned, along with details such as expiration dates and certification statuses.
                     Some certifications are valid for a lifetime, while others have an expiry date. The application also includes a manager dashboard, 
                     where managers can view all certifications within their team and track their employees' certification statuses.</p>

                    <li><strong>Automated Notifications:</strong> Notifications are sent to employees and managers
